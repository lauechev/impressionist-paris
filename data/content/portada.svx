## What is Impressionism?

Impressionism was a revolutionary art movement that emerged in France during the late 19th century, characterized by its focus on capturing fleeting moments and the effects of light and color. Breaking away from the rigid structures of academic painting, Impressionist artists like Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Edgar Degas emphasized spontaneity and sought to depict scenes of everyday life, landscapes, and urban environments with loose brushstrokes and vibrant colors.

 Rather than aiming for exact detail, they prioritized the sensory experience of a scene, often painting outdoors to catch natural light. This movement not only transformed the art world but also paved the way for modernist approaches, influencing generations of artists to come.
